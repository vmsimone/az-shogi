        <h3>What is Shogi?</h3>
        <p>
          Literally, the "General's Game" (or "Game of Generals"), shogi, is a two-player Japanese strategy board game. Similar to the Western game of chess, the object of the game is to capture (checkmate) the opponent's king. Like the game of chess, shogi's origins are tied to the ancient Indian game of chaturanga. Although it's not clear when shogi was born, it's believed that chaturanga (or a version of it) made its way to Japan from India, either through China and then Korea or thorugh Southeast Asia during the Nara Era (710 - 794), and then inspired an early version of shogi popular during the Heian Era (794 - 1185). The oldest shogi pieces that have been discovered to day (a set of 16) date back to around 1058. While it has changed quite a bit since then, some people consider shogi to be not merely a game, but a traditional piece of Japanese culture, an artform like haiku and tea ceremonies.
          <br><br>
          Shogi is often referred to as "Japanese chess", but it is no mere variation, and there are a few key differences that set the games far apart in complexity and strategy. One major rule is that nearly every piece has a "promoted" version with an alternate moveset, allowing unique angles of attack. The second is that captured pieces can be "dropped" back onto the board, meaning every piece is always in play! This makes calculating many moves ahead a greater challenge and means that very few games ever reach a draw.

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>
          There are many guidebooks online and in print, but one of the easiest places to start is with <a href="https://lishogi.org/learn">lishogi.org's learn page</a>. It provides an interactive board and puzzles aimed at teaching the basic mechanics of the game. You can also use the settings icon in the upper right to change the piece styles if you have trouble remembering the kanji or prefer a different font.

            <p>The Japan Shogi Association (Nihon Shogi Renmei) released a series of videos designed to help beginners understand the basic strategies behind the game. These lectures come with English subtitles and cover the fundamental concepts that all beginners should know. This is a great second step after learning the rules.</p>

            <p>Tomohide Kawasaki, known online as "Hidetchi", is perhaps the most prolific shogi promoter in the English speaking world. For a time, outside of niche mailing lists and books, Hidetchi's videos were the only easily available English materials covering the rules and strategies of shogi online. He is one of the creators of 81Dojo, developed an international piece set, and has helped translate and write several books on shogi, including a dictionary on terminology. While not very active recently, his videos are still regarded as some of the best ways to learn the game more in-depth.</p>
