        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          While not the most popular game in the USA, this exciting, traditional strategy game from Japan has had fans from the United States since the early 1990s! We wanted to bring some of that excitement into the modern day, make it easier for experienced players to find each other, and offer new players and interested prospects an easy way to find shogi clubs and events in their local area. While not an official organization, we hope our efforts can help ease communication and make games more accessible to everyone. <br>
          Scroll down or use the links at the top to find a club, see the latest information, or learn more about shogi!

        <h3>What is Shogi?</h3>
        <p>
          Literally, the "General's Game" (or "Game of Generals"), shogi, is a two-player Japanese strategy board game. Similar to the Western game of chess, the object of the game is to capture (checkmate) the opponent's king. Like the game of chess, shogi's origins are tied to the ancient Indian game of chaturanga. Although it's not clear when shogi was born, it's believed that chaturanga (or a version of it) made its way to Japan from India, either through China and then Korea or thorugh Southeast Asia during the Nara Era (710 - 794), and then inspired an early version of shogi popular during the Heian Era (794 - 1185). The oldest shogi pieces that have been discovered to day (a set of 16) date back to around 1058. While it has changed quite a bit since then, some people consider shogi to be not merely a game, but a traditional piece of Japanese culture, an artform like haiku and tea ceremonies.
          <br><br>
          Shogi is often referred to as "Japanese chess", but it is no mere variation, and there are a few key differences that set the games far apart in complexity and strategy. One major rule is that nearly every piece has a "promoted" version with an alternate moveset, allowing unique angles of attack. The second is that captured pieces can be "dropped" back onto the board, meaning every piece is always in play! This makes calculating many moves ahead a greater challenge and means that very few games ever reach a draw.

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>
          There are many guidebooks online and in print, but one of the easiest places to start is with <a href="https://lishogi.org/learn">lishogi.org's learn page</a>. It provides an interactive board and puzzles aimed at teaching the basic mechanics of the game. You can also use the settings icon in the upper right to change the piece styles if you have trouble remembering the kanji or prefer a different font.
        </p>
        <h3>Strategies and Tactics</h3>
        <p>
          Once you've learned the basic rules, you can jump right in and <a href="#play">start playing</a> or, if you'd like to get more information on strategies, check out some of the below videos and guides:

            <p>Tomohide Kawasaki, known online as "Hidetchi", is perhaps the most prolific shogi promoter in the English speaking world. For a time, outside of niche mailing lists and books, Hidetchi's videos were the only easily available English materials covering the rules and strategies of shogi online. He is one of the creators of 81Dojo, developed an international piece set, and has helped translate and write several books on shogi, including a dictionary on terminology. While not very active recently, his videos are still regarded as some of the best ways to learn the game more in-depth.</p>

        <h2>Let's Play!</h2>
        <p>If you're having trouble <a href="#links">finding a club in your area</a>, there are several websites and apps where you can play shogi with other players online. Descriptions of a few better-known sites are included below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4><a href="https://system.81dojo.com/en">81Dojo</a></h4>
            <p>81Dojo is considered to be the most authentic shogi experience you can get online. While the user interface is somewhat dated, the attention to detail is incomparable. Just like you might see your opponent reaching for a piece over-the-board, any piece they click on is highlighted. There are no movement guides and illegal moves are allowed, but result in an instant loss, just like a tournament. Finally, the game only ends when one side resigns, rather than an automatic checkmate win, and post-game analysis can be done with the opponent immediately afterward. There are also apps for both Android and iOS to play on a mobile device. As the interface can be somewhat daunting, Shogi Harbour has created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shM5ix49F6Y">a video guide</a> for first time users.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4><a href="https://lishogi.org/">lishogi</a></h4>
            <p>Created as a fork from lichess, lishogi is an open-source, free site designed to be easily accessible to anyone. It has a modern, responsive design, many customization options for boards and pieces, and a wide array of puzzles and user-submitted studies. While the player-base is rather small compared to ther sites, the option to send an invite link to anyone for a game without needing to register makes lishogi a great option for more casual, friendly games.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4><a href="https://shogiwars.heroz.jp/?locale=en">ShogiWars</a></h4>
            <p>A primarily Japanese site with a decent English translation, ShogiWars probably has the largest playerbase of any site. After signing up, you can click "Game Start" on either the app or browser version and find an opponent within seconds. However, time controls are short, and "speed shogi" is often very different from a typical game. In addition, the free-to-play version only allows up to three games per day; you'll need to pay for a membership if you want to keep going.</p>
